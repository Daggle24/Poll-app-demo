### **What to Build**

A web application where:

1. A user can **create a poll** with a question and 2–5 answer options  
2. The poll generates a **shareable link** (or unique ID)  
3. Other users can open the link and **cast a vote**  
4. The **results** are displayed visually (e.g. progress bars, a simple chart)

That's it. Keep it simple, keep it working.
